ajax-todo-list - simple AJAX based single user TODO list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AJAX Todo List is an example of good MVC based client side application
design.

I am not planning for further development of this application right now.
This may change in the future.

Try demo at: http://ajax-todo-list.megous.com/

Features:

- Client side based TODO list with task categories that communicates
  with server using JSON-RPC 1.1.
- Clean OOP design based on the MVC pattern.
- No authentication.
- Almost completely stylable by CSS.
- KISS server side.

Compatibility:

- Tested in Safari 3.1.2, IE 6.0, IE 7.0, Firefox 3

Missing stuff:

- Show only recent TODOs (show only this week's tasks or so).
- Push missed tasks to today.

Installation:

- Copy files to the directory on the server.
- Create database.
- Configure database access (username, password).
- Done.

How you can help to improve the application:

- Feel free to contact me if you would like to add more features.

License:

- Public Domain, or possibly GPL because of Texy! integration. I don't
  really care about the licensing stuff.
